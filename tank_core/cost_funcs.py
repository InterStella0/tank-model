'''
Necessary cost function for model calibration and validation
    R2:
        Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient(R) squared
        Range [0 to 1]
        higher is better maximum possible value =1
    
    NSE: 
        Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficienct
        Range [-inf to 1]
        NSE value 1 means a perfect model
        NSE > 0.6 is considerd as a good model.
    
    MSE: 
        Mean Squared Error
        lower is better
    
    RMSE:    
        Root Mean Squared Error
        squared root of MSE
        lower is better
